# mruby-editline
mruby binding for [editline(3)](http://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?editline++NetBSD-current) library.

## Usage
```rb
el = EditLine.new
el.set_prompt "prompt> "

el.set_addfn("mruby-editline-sample-complete", "complete a word") do |ch|
  el.insertstr "hello!"
  EditLine::CC_REFRESH
end
el.set_bind("^I", "mruby-editline-sample-complete")

while line = el.gets
  puts "cmd =>" + line
end
```

## API Reference
### EditLine class
- `.new`
  - Create a new EditLine instance. (`el_init`)
- `#gets -> String|nil`
  - Read a line from the tty.  Returns the line read if successful, returns
    nil if no characters were read, or raises a RuntimeError if an error
    occurred. (`el_gets`)
- `#deletestr(str)`
  - Delete `count` characters before the cursor.
- `#insertstr(str) -> Fixnum`
  - Insert str into the line at the cursor.  Returns -1 if str is empty or
    won't fit, and 0 otherwise. (`el_insertstr`)
- `#line -> [String, Fixnum]`
  - Return the current line and the position of cursor. (`el_line`)
- `#parse(argv) -> Fixnum`
  - Parses the `argv` array to execute builtin editline commands.  If the
    command is prefixed with "prog:" then el_parse() will only execute
    the command if "prog" matches the prog argument supplied to el_init().
    The return value is -1 if the command is unknown, 0 if there was no
    error or "prog" didn't match, or 1 if the command returned
    an error.  Refer to editrc(5) for more information. (`el_parse`)
- `#push(str)`
  - Pushes str back onto the input stream.  This is used by the macro
    expansion mechanism.  Refer to the description of bind -s in
    [editrc(5)](http://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?editrc++NetBSD-current)
    for more information.
- `#resize`
  - Must be called if the terminal size changes.  If `#set_signal(flag)`
    has been called with non-zero `flag`, then this is done automatically.
    Otherwise, it's the responsibility of the application to call
    `el_resize()` on the appropriate occasions. (`el_resize`)
- `#set_addfn(name, help, &proc)`
  - add an user defined function `name`.  `help` is a description of it.
    `proc` is a callback function.  The return value of `proc` should be
    one of EditLine::CC_nnn. (`el_set(EL_ADDFN)`)
  - Caveats: You cannot define more than 10 functions.  If you need more,
    change lines around the definition of `USERFUNCTIONS` in src/editline.c.
- `#set_bind(key, proc)`
  - `proc` can be String or Proc. (`el_set(EL_BIND)`)
- `#set_prompt(proc, c=nil)`
  - Define prompt printing function as `proc`, which is to return a string
    that contains the prompt. (`el_set(EL_PROMPT)`, `el_set(EL_PROMPT_ESC)`)
    - Note: ANSI escape sequence in prompt string does not work as expected
      due to a bug in editline library.
- `#set_setty(*args) -> Fixnum`
  - Perform the setty builtin command.  Refer to editrc(5) for more
    information. (`el_set(EL_SETTY)`)
- `#set_signal(flag) -> Fixnum`
  - If flag is non-zero, editline will install its own signal handler
    for the following signals when reading command input: SIGCONT,
    SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGQUIT, SIGSTOP, SIGTERM, SIGTSTP, and SIGWINCH.
    Otherwise, the current signal handlers will be used.
    (`el_set(EL_SIGNAL)`)
- `#get_gettc(name) -> String|Fixnum`
  - If name is a valid termcap(5) capability, return the current value of
    that capability. (`el_get(EL_GETTC)`)
    - If not, raises an ArgumentError.
